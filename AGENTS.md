# ePiE Agents

## Package Installation

**Use `R CMD INSTALL Package` — not `devtools::install_local()`.** The `devtools` package has heavy dependencies (gert, usethis, libgit2) that may fail to install. `R CMD INSTALL` works without them.

After installing, run `Rscript scripts/smoke-test.R` to verify.

## Development Workflow

Use `pkgload::load_all("Package")` during development so changes to R source and map styling are used immediately without reinstalling. Use `R CMD INSTALL Package` only when validating the installed-package workflow.

## Test Commands

```r
# Run all tests
Rscript -e 'library(testthat); library(ePiE); test_check("ePiE")'

# Run a single test file
Rscript -e 'library(testthat); library(ePiE); test_file("Package/tests/testthat/test-network-topology.R")'

# Run tests with checkpoint helpers (load them first)
source("Package/tests/testthat/helper-checkpoints.R")
```

## Key Entry Points

- `LoadScenarioConfig(name, data_root, output_root)` — loads config from `Package/inst/config/`, returns a named list. No package install needed for config changes.
- `BuildNetworkPipeline(cfg, diagnostics = "full")` — builds river network, saves `pts.csv`, `HL.csv`, `network_rivers.shp`, and maps to `cfg$run_output_dir`. **Must run before simulation.**
- `RunSimulationPipeline(state, substance, cpp = FALSE)` — computes concentrations, generates maps. `state` must come from `BuildNetworkPipeline` (or a pre-built `pts.csv` + `HL.csv`).
- `ListScenarios()` — lists all 30 named scenarios.

## Pipeline Order

Network build is a 10-step pipeline: LoadInputs → PrepareCanals → ProcessRivers → ProcessLakes → ExtractPopulation → MapWWTPs → BuildTopology → IntegratePoints → ConnectLakes → SaveArtifacts → Visualize.

Simulation is a 6-step pipeline: Normalize → AssignHydrology → SetUpstream → InitializeSubstance → ComputeConcentrations → Visualize.

Hydrology node export (`hydrology_nodes.csv`) is written after simulation in `RunSimulationPipeline()` via `ExportHydrologyNodes()` so Q/V/H and concentration fields can be merged in one table.

## Data Setup

```bash
./scripts/setup-data.sh                    # download basins, user data, pre-built networks
./scripts/setup-data.sh . v1.26.0          # same, explicit args
EPIE_SKIP_R_DEPS=1 ./scripts/setup-data.sh # skip R package installation
```

Baseline raster data (HydroSHEDS, FLO1K, WorldClim, GHS-POP) is not bundled — download manually from official sources into `Inputs/baselines/`.

## Scenario Config Architecture

Config lives in `Package/inst/config/` (packaged with the library):

- `basins/*.R` — basin-level data paths (shapefiles, rasters, CRS). Basin configs are shared across network + simulation scenarios.
- `scenarios/*.R` — scenario-level parameters (substance type, output dir, input paths). Scenario configs reference basin configs.

`LoadScenarioConfig()` sources all basin + scenario configs into an environment, then calls the matching scenario function. To add a new basin or scenario, create the corresponding files and rebuild the package.

## C++ Engine

The C++ code lives in `Package/src/`. `Makevars` enforces C++11. `RcppExports.cpp` and `Package/R/RcppExports.R` are auto-generated. After changing exported C++ function signatures, run `Rscript -e 'Rcpp::compileAttributes("Package")'`, then rebuild/install (`R CMD INSTALL Package` or `R CMD build . && R CMD INSTALL ePiE_*.tar.gz`).

The R fallback is controlled by `cpp = FALSE` in `RunSimulationPipeline`; default is the R fallback unless `cpp = TRUE` is passed.

## Canal Metadata Passthrough

Canal identification (`is_canal`) and modeled discharge (`Q_model_m3s`) flow through both the C++ and R concentration engines. Both engines return these fields in their output data.frame so that visualization can distinguish canal segments from natural rivers.

The R fallback engine (`Compute_env_concentrations_v4`) has defensive fallbacks for missing columns (`is_canal` defaults to `FALSE`, `Q_model_m3s` to `NA_real_`, `dist_nxt` to `0`), matching the pattern used by the C++ engine call site in `02_ComputeEnvConcentrations.R`.

`ExportHydrologyNodes()` writes `hydrology_nodes.csv` after simulation with Q/V/H and concentration columns merged into a single inspection table.

## Known Data Gaps (Not Bugs)

- FLO1K rasters don't cover Africa: all HydroSHEDS Volta scenarios produce Q=0 (all-NA concentrations).
- No WWTPs in Volta networks: chemical scenarios produce zero emissions for Volta.
- GeoGLOWS wet and dry use the same river network; seasonality comes from monthly discharge columns.

## Map Rendering

`scripts/run_all_scenarios.R` uses `pkgload::load_all()` so map styling changes in the workspace are used during scenario runs. If maps were generated before a style update, re-run `VisualizeConcentrations()` on existing `simulation_results.csv` to refresh only the visualization layer.
